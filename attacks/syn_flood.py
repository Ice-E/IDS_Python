def syn_flood(target_ip, target_port):
    """
    Sends a burst of TCP SYN packets to the target IP and port, simulating a SYN flood attack.

    This function crafts raw TCP/IP packets with the SYN flag set to initiate connections 
    without completing the TCP handshake, potentially overwhelming the target system's 
    resources.

    Parameters:
    - target_ip (str): The destination IP address to flood.
    - target_port (int): The TCP port to target on the destination host.

    Warning:
    SYN flood attacks are considered denial-of-service (DoS) techniques and are illegal 
    to perform on unauthorized systems. Use this function strictly in isolated, controlled 
    lab environments for educational or testing purposes only.
