def port_scan(ip="127.0.0.1", ports=range(20, 50)):
    """
    Performs a basic TCP port scan on the specified IP address.

    Parameters:
    - ip (str): The target IP address to scan. Defaults to localhost (127.0.0.1).
    - ports (iterable): A range or list of ports to scan. Defaults to range(20, 50).

    Notes:
    - This function attempts to establish a TCP connection to each port.
    - A short timeout is used for faster scanning.
    - No results are printed or returned â€” only the scan is executed.
    
    Warning:
    Unauthorized port scanning may be illegal or against terms of service.
    Always scan only systems you own or have permission to test.
